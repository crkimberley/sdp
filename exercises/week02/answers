Exercise sheet | S.O.L.I.D.

Ex.03
Examine the ControlUnit.pollSensors() method.
What are its current responsibilities?

 - create new list of Sensors
 - create new FireSensor
 - create new SmokeSensor
 - poll sensors
 - print sensor types and locations


Ex.05
Investigate the pollSensors method again, as you did in the previous exercise.
What are the responsibilities now?

 - poll sensors
 - print sensor types and locations



Ex.06
A new use case! This is no longer a alarm system for only detecting hazards, it
should now also include security such as motion and heat sensors. However, these
sensors don't run on a battery so one of the Sensor interface methods is
suddenly redundant for a whole set of sensors.
Which method is this and what SOLID principle does this break?
