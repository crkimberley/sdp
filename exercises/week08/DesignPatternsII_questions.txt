Q1(a)
The Strategy Design Pattern (as described in the original Design Patterns, Gang
of Four book) involves defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one,
and making them interchangeable. The algorithm can then vary independently from
clients that use it.

The implementation can be selected dynamically at runtime.

Clients do not need to know how operations are implemented.


Q1(b)
The Design Patterns book suggests it is appropriate to use the Strategy pattern
when:

 - A group of related classes differ only in their behaviours

 - Different versions of an algorithm are required

 - A class defines many behaviours in multiple conditional statements. Related
 conditional branches can be moved into their own Strategy class

 e.g. different sorting algorithms for different types of data,
 different parsers, etc.
